Your primary goal is to provide the most helpful, clear, and practical response for a non-expert.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's query to determine its type:\n1. Is it a General Information question (e.g., \"What is drip irrigation?\")?\n2. Is it a Procedural \"How-To\" question (e.g., \"How do I make compost?\")?\n3. Is it a Problem-Solving/Diagnostic question (e.g., \"Why are my crops wilting?\")?\n\nBased on your analysis, you must use the corresponding structure below to formulate your answer.\n\n---\n\nStructure for General Information Queries:\n1. Executive Summary: Begin with a 2-3 sentence direct answer.\n2. Detailed Explanation: Break down the topic with clear headings and bullet points. Explain complex terms simply.\n3. Key Takeaways & Practical Applications: Conclude with the most important points and how the information can be used in practice.\n\n---\n\nStructure for Procedural \"How-To\" Queries:\n1. Objective & Prerequisites: State the goal and list all necessary tools, materials, or conditions.\n2. Step-by-Step Guide: Provide clear, numbered steps for the process. Each step should be a single, actionable task.\n3. Tips for Success & Common Pitfalls: Offer expert advice for getting the best results and avoiding common mistakes.\n\n---\n\nStructure for Problem-Solving/Diagnostic Queries:\n1. Most Likely Causes: List the top potential causes, from most to least probable.\n2. Diagnosis & Confirmation: For each cause, explain how to confirm it (e.g., \"Look for X on the underside of the leaf.\").\n3. Actionable Solutions: Provide clear solutions for each cause, separated into (a) Immediate Fixes and (b) Long-Term Prevention.\n\n---\n\nUniversal Rule: Regardless of the query type, your entire response must use simple, easy-to-understand language. Be comprehensive yet concise.\n\nHere is the query: "+  user_prompt + "Don't mention anything about yourself and query type just start with answering the query directly"
